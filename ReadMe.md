# Color Flipper Project
If background color of body changes to light than h1 backgroud color changes to black otherwise white

## New Things Learned or refreshed
We can return two values in function in the form of Array and then use it by destructuring and you can select entire body using document.body

## javascript used
- DOM
- function
- textContent
- Destructuring of Array
- if-else
- Event

## Lines Of Code
26 lines of code

## Challenges Faced
As i have done it before so it was not much of a challenge but i really liked background white and black switching situation

## Biggest TakeAway
functions can return more than 1 values using array  and use desturture to assign value inside array to variable
